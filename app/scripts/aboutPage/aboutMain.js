            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
              Women in Computing at Calvin College is a relatively new club created by alumni Lydia
              Cupery, Paige Brinks, and Beka Agava as a way to connect and support women studying
              technology here at Calvin. But WIC isn't just for women--we encourage anyone interested
              to join us as we strive to make the STEM field a more inclusive and diverse
              place fo everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the things we do as a club are: set up mentorship program for our members,
              tour local companies, homework nights in the lab, workshops, attend women in tech
              events and conferences. Subscribe to our mailing list to be the first to hear about
              these events!
